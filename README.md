# Project2
Peter Serrano
Name: Peter Serrano
Overview of Project: In this project, it was to design a giph search application that takes giphs from Giphy based on what a user types.
Details: The search engine will allow the user to type any word or phrase and once clicked, will allow the user to view gifs based on their search.
         There is also a "Go back" button which will allow the user to quickly go back to the top of the screen.
Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, An API from Giphy that contains all the giphs while also using Jquery, Bootstrap, and tailwind to make the website more responsive.
Ideas for Future Improvements: As much as I love the skeleton, I feel more could've been added to make the site feel more alive, I hope to style my sites better.
                               I also wish to add a sort of limit button for how many giphs the user wants to filter and see.
